            Lyrics
        </h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
        Carved out of stone
        Earth, blood and bone
        They knock the mountains down
        The earth's grating sounds
        
        They soothe the great machines
        That yearn desperately
        Just to lay them down
        Within her gaping mouth
        
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        
        They wander ridges high
        Between the earth and sky
        Like spikes upon a crown
        We wear upon our brow
        
        And want is not a need
        Reserved for human beings
        It's fingers on your throat
        Is pain that all things know
        
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        
        An army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart's lands
        Eating all reality
        Producing only dust and sand
        Nothing hurts them
        Nothing gets under their stone skin
        And when their earthen mouths will open up
        And just what words should come out but
        <strong>"We wish we were dead"</strong>
            </pre>
        </p>
